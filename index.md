Vince Ketchum is a **famous** Pokémon trainer. Recently he has become very curious about the nature of Pokémon and has hired you, a young, budding statistician, to conduct a research project.

<p align="center"><img class="prof" src="https://merrickmath.github.io/MerrickMath.github.io-PokemonChallenge/trainer.png" alt="Trainer Vince Ketchum"></p>

Vince has collected data on 802 species of Pokémon and has entered his data into the [challenge.csv](https://merrickmath.github.io/MerrickMath.github.io-PokemonChallenge/challenge.csv) file (right-click to download to your home desktop). Vince has also noted that there is a more detailed dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon).

The dataset contains 802 observations and 12 variables:

- **Name:** Name of Pokémon
- **Type:** Type of Pokémon
- **Height:** Height of Pokémon in **metres**
- **Weight:** Weight of Pokémon in **kilograms**
- **Capture Rate**
- **Happiness:** Baseline happiness of Pokémon
- **HP:** Hit Points of a given Pokémon
- **Attack:** Base Attack of Pokémon
- **Defense:** Base Defense of Pokémon
- **Speed:** Base Speed of Pokémon
- **Generation:** Generation in which the Pokémon was first introduced
- **Is_legendary:** Whether the Pokémon is legendary or non-legendary

Vince has formulated some **important** questions that will help him defeat the notorious Team Rocket:

- **What is the strongest Pokémon? Why?**  
  What makes a Pokémon strong? Do some Pokémon have higher attributes than others?

- **Do a Pokémon’s attributes (Attack, Defense, weight, height, Speed, etc.) vary based on its type?**  
  Perhaps “Dragon” Pokémon are significantly heavier than “Bug” Pokémon. Perhaps “Fire” Pokémon have higher attack than “Water” Pokémon.

- **Are legendary Pokémon significantly stronger than non-legendary Pokémon?**  
  Vince believes “legendary” Pokémon are stronger; does the data support this?

- **Emotional Pikachu:**  
  Vince’s Pikachu has a base happiness of 120. Is this **significantly** “high” or “low”?

- **Is there an association between a Pokémon’s weight and height?**  
  Do heavier Pokémon tend to be taller?

- **Have Pokémon from newer generations become stronger or weaker than those in older generations?**  
  Is there a generational difference in attributes?

For your report, Vince asks that you explore 2 (or more) of these questions. You are also **encouraged** to raise questions of your own. Your report may be delivered in **any** format (PDF, Word document, video, website, etc.). You will be judged on a 20-point scale:

- **Mathematical and statistical argumentation** (10 points)
- **Aesthetic** (10 points)

Good luck, and have fun!
