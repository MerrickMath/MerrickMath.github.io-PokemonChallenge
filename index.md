Vince Ketchum is a **famous** Pokémon trainer. Recently he has become very curious about the nature of Pokémon and has hired you, a young, budding statistician, to conduct a research project. 

<p align="center"> <img class="prof" src="https://merrickmath.github.io/MerrickMath.github.io-PokemonChallenge/trainer.png">   </p>

Vince has collected data on 802 types of Pokémon, and has inputted his data into the <a href="https://merrickmath.github.io/MerrickMath.github.io-PokemonChallenge/challenge.csv"> challenge.csv </a> file (right click to download to home desktop). Vince has also noted that there is a more detailed dataset that can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon"> here </a>. The dataset contains 802 obervations and 12 variables:
* **Name:** Name of Pokémon 
* **Type:** Type of Pokémon 
* **Height:** Height of Pokémon in **metres**
* **Weight:** Weight of Pokémon in **kilograms**
* **Capture Rate** 
* **Happiness:** Baseline happiness of Pokémon
* **HP:** Hit Points of giving Pokémon
* **Attack:** Base Attack of Pokémon 
* **Defense:** Base Defense of Pokémon 
* **Speed:** Base Speed of Pokémon 
* **Generation:** Generation that the pokemon was first introduced
* **Is_legendary:** If the Pokémon is legendary or non-legendary 


Vince has formulated some **important** questions that will help him defeat the notorious Team Rocket:
* **What is the strongest Pokemon? Why?** 
What makes a Pokémon strong? Do some Pokémon have higher attributes than other? 

* **Do a Pokémon's attributes (Attack, Defense, weight, height, Speed, etc.) vary based on its type?** 
For this question Vince is trying to understand how all attributes of a Pokémon vary based on type. Perhaps 'Dragon' Pokémon are significantly heavier than 'Bug' Pokémon. Perhaps 'Fire' Pokémon have higher attack than 'Water' Pokémon. 

* **Are legendary Pokémon significantly stronger than non-legendary pokemon?** 
Vince has discovered a new type of Pokémon referred to as 'legendary' that he believes are significantly stronger than regular Pokémon. He would like to know if the data provides sufficient evidence of his hypothesis. 

* **Emotional Pikachu:** 
Vince's Pikachu has base happiness of 120. He would like to know if this can be considered a **significantly** 'high' or 'low' happiness score. 

* **Is there an association between a Pokémon's weight and height?** 
Vince has noticed that Pokémon come in all different shapes and sizes; he is curious if a Pokémon's weight is associated with its height.

* **Have Pokémon from new generations become stronger/weaker than those in older generations?**
Pokémon are released in generations. Vince is curious if there is a significant difference between the attributes of Pokémon based on their generation. 

For your report, Vince asks that you explore 2 (or more) of these questions. You are also **encouraged** to raise questions on your own that you may answer/explore in your report. Your report may be delivered in **any** format (pdf, word document, video, website, etc.). You will be judged on a 20 point scale made up of two categories:
* **Mathematical and statistical argumentation** (10 points)
* **Aesthetic** (10 points)

Good luck, and have fun!
