Vince Catchem is a **famous** Pokemon trainer. Recently he has become very curious with the nature of Pokemon and has hired you, a young budding statistician, to conduct do a research project.

Vince has collected data on all 802 types of Pokemon, and has inputted his data into the <a href="https://merrickmath.github.io/MerrickMath.github.io-PokemonChallenge/challenge.csv"> challenge.csv </a> file (right click to download to home desktop). Vince has also noted that there is a more detailed dataset that can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon"> here </a>. The dataset contains 802 obervations and 12 variables:
* **Name:** Name of Pokemon 
* **Type:** Type of Pokemon 
* **Height:** Height of pokemon in **meters**
* **Weight:** Weight of pokemon in **kilograms**
* **Capture Rate:** Capture rate for given pokemon
* **Happiness:** Baseline happiness of pokemon
* **HP:** Hit points of giving pokemon
* **Attack:** Base attack of pokemon 
* **Defense:** Base defense of pokemon 
* **Speed:** Base speed of pokemon 
* **Generation:** Generation that the pokemon was first introduced
* **Is_legendary:** If the pokemon is legendary or non-legendary 


Vince has formulated some **important** questions that will help him defeat the notorious Team Rocket:
* **What is the strongest Pokemon? Why?** 
What makes a pokemon strong? Do some pokemon have higher attributes than other? 

* **Do a pokemon's attributes (attack, defense, weight, height, speed, etc.) vary based on its type?** 
For this question Vince is trying to understand how all attributes of a pokemon vary based on type. Perhaps 'dragon' pokemon are significantly heavier than 'bug' pokemon. Perhaps 'fire' pokemon have higher attack than 'water' pokemon. 

* **Are legendary pokemon significantly sttronger than normal pokemon?** 
Vince has discovered a new type of pokemon reffered to as 'legendary' that he beleives significantly stronger than regular pokemon. He would like to know if the data provides sufficient evidence of his hypothesis. 

* **Emotional Pikachu** 
Vince's pickachu has base happiness of 120. He would like to know if this can be considered a **significantly** 'high' or 'low' happiness score. 

* **Is there an assosciation between a Pokemon's weight and height?** 
Vince has noticed that pokemon come in all different shapes and sizes, he is curious if a pokemon's weight is assosciated with its height.

* **Have pokemon from new generations become stronger/weaker than those in older generations?**
Pokemon are released in generations. Vince is curious if there is a significant difference between the attribues of pokemon based on their generation. 

For your report Vince asks that you explore 2 (or more) of these questions. You are also **encouraged** to raise questions on your own that you may answer/explore in your report. Your report may be delivered in **any** format (pdf, word document, video, website, etc.). You will be judged on a 20 point scale made up of two categories:
* **Mathematical and statistical arguemntation** (10 points)
* **Aesthetic** (10 points)

Good luck, and have fun!
